# ðŸš€ PORTFOLIO

This project is my programming portfolio app. I am developing it with the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/).
**The portfolio can be viewed at [this Netlify site](https://portfolio-satu-hyvarinen.netlify.app/).**

### How to use locally?

To run the project locally, type in terminal the command
`npm run dev`

and open a browser at
`localhost:3000`

### Deployment

When changes to code have been committed and pushed to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/tsirbunen/portfolio) (by me), the changes are automatically deployed to the app's Netlify site (by Netlify).
